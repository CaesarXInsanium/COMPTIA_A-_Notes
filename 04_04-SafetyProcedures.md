- remove all power source before working
- dont touich anythjing if not sure
replace entire supply units. dont repair it
- hgih voltage: power supplir displays, laser printers
## Equipment Grounding
- most computer connect to the ground
- also applies to equiptment racks
- dont remove ground connection its for protection
## NEVER CONNECT SELF TO ELECTRICAL GROUND
# Toxis Waste
## batteries
- uninterruptivle power supplies
- discpose at local hazardous waste facility
## CRTs
- cathod ray tubes are still around
- glass contains lead
- dispose at local facility
## toner
- recycle and reuse

# Managing Electrical Discharge
## What is it?
- static electricy, does not move
- generally not harmful to vomputers, unless it start moving again
- ESD can be damaging to computer components: silicon is sensitive to higher voltages
- only 100 volts of discharge can damage components. 
## controlling ESD
- huminity at over 60% helps control ESD
- wont prevent all
- air conditioning and 60% huminity is not practical
- use hand to self ground, touch metal chassis before touching other component
- always unplug power connection
- try not to touch components directly
- card edges only
## do not plug self into electrical ground
## prevention
- anti static strap: wear on wrist and clip on part of computer case to ground
- anti static pad: workplace for computer. can connect to strap
- anti static amt: for sitting and standing
- anti static bag: carry componets around
