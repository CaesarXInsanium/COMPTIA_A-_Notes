# SSID management
- service set identifier, name of wifi network
- change SSID
- disable SSID broadcast
- only is security obscurity
# Wireless Encryption
- all wires computers are radio transmitters and receiveers
- anyone can lisen
- encrypt the data, everyone gets a password
- WPA2 encryption
# Access point
- multiple access points at larger properties
- multiple channels to reduce interferance
# Power level controls
- set as low as possible to that it is limted to only what is needed
- how low is low
- certain received can still listen in
# using WPS
- wifi protected setup
- allows for easy setup of mobile device
- different ways to connect. pin must be entered on access point
- push button, near field communication, 
- USB key method - depracated
## flaw
- PIN is a design flaw, 8 digit number, but only 11,000 possibilities
- can be brute fored easily
# DEfault username and passwords
- all access points have default usernames and passwords -> change them
- can be easy to find the default passwords online
# MAC address filtering
- MEdia Access Control
- set filters based on MAC address
- MAC address can be spoofed
- free open-source software
- MAC address is not 
# IP addressing
- automatic IP configuration
- ip configuration can be set manually
- does not serve security purposes
- security trough obscurity
# SOHO firewalls
- small office and home office applicens
- can include WAP, router, firewall, content filter
- can provide dynamic routing, remote support
- keep updated
# firewall settings
- inboud traffic: allows only required traffic, configure port forwarding
- DMZ
- outbound traffic: blacklist allows all but blocks select. whitelist block everything but allows select
# disabling ports
- enabled physical ports, conferance rooms, break rooms
- disable unused prots
- NAC, Network Access protocol. no communication unless authenticated
# Content Filtering
- control traffic daa based on content
- corporate control of outbound and inbound data
- sensitive material or innapropiate content
- not safe for work, parental controls
- protection against evil
# Physical security
0 easy to hack.
- all thing behind lock and key.
- try to add additional authentication
- should be documented and well implemented
